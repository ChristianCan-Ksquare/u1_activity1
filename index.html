          <li>
            Discovering of the Hawking Radiation. Instead of understanding all
            black holes as simple gravitational gluttons that can only ever grow
            in mass, Hawking Radiation explains how black holes can actually
            leak energy to the point of disappearance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Explanation of the Creation of the Universe. Applying the concepts
            of Quantum physics and general relativity he proved that the
            Universe was created due to the explosion of singularity trapped in
            an infinetly small space and that no creator was involved in the
            process. This theory was widely accepted and also helped scrutinize
            the behaviour of black holes and furthermore the nature of the
            universe.
          </li>
          <li>
            His book, A Brief History of Time, became an international
            best-seller, making Sthepen one of the world's most successful
            popularizers of science.
          </li>
          <li>
            He became one of the most famous scientist in the world despite
            having a severe physical disability caused by motor neurone disease.
